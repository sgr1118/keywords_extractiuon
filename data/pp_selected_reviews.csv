"can. pale gold colour, with a light, fine head. first sipwow bang smacks of dryness its slight shock if your thirsty . it was served so cold the aroma's escaped me and come to think about it, so did the flavour",Asahi Super Dry,Positive
reminds me of what a lite beer brewed by warsteiner would taste like: same grainy flavor with a watery palate. quickly disapating head. there are doubtless much better things to drink with sushi.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"light to medium gold color and white head start this one. aroma is very lightnot much to it at all. the flavor also lacks any real definition. not crisp, not much of anything. not a very good beer.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative

watery. some malt. very clear. strange taste in finish. not so bad,Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"poured a shiny yellow with moderate carbonation and a ghost of a head. slight cornesque aroma. in the mouth there was some grassiness but mostly a smooth rice character somewhat reminiscent of a water sake. while lacking in malt profile or complexity, it did live up to its billing as dry.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"asahi maybe the japanese word for watery rice beer? light yellow gold in color, very clear. head is foamy white, sibsides quickly. nose of rice? i don''t know rice wine, rice beer, japanese cuisine likes its rice. i''ll stick to sake.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative

a must have beer if your eating sushi or sashimi. find the flavour abit hard with out the food.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"very dry. i personally think it is more refreshing in the heat, as opposed to a regular pale lager. nothing really special about this beer, other than the new monstrous can, and the fact that it is a little sharper on the finish. i would take this over another standard lager from another huge brewery.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"tasted like cheap american beer. so dry, i wasn''t sure i even had a beer by the end. skunky smell, extremly pale, no taste.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
standard japanese mass produced beer. super watery would have been a better name for the beer.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative

dry and crisp with a clean flavor. not a whole lot going on here,Asahi Super Dry,Positive
"your standard large breweried lager, totally ordinary. nothing bad, nothing to make it stand out. grainy aroma, metallic malt flavor.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative

"bottles had with a fine dinner at a ryokan in kyoto, japan. a foamy white head. a crisp dry flavor that goes down easy.",Asahi Super Dry,Positive

"blond lager. very light malt aroma. watery, pretty dry",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"i did not rate this beer that well, but i do enjoy it now and then. mostly at restaurants when someone else is paying, it is not nearly good enough to justify the premium you pay to get it in bottles.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
i like to get this when i go to a japanese steakhouse like samurai or benihana. otherwise i do not have much use for it.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative
you can do better for cheaper than this. mine said brewed in canada.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative

"a rather bland offering from asahi. i much prefer their draft and black brews. this one seems overprocessed , the typical curse of japanese beers.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"light head, light carbonation and a light taste. this is another japanese beer available domestically as an import that is brewed under supervision by molson breweries, canada.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"a very drinkable beer. it is good with a meal when you do not really want to pay attention to the beer. in my opinion, that is all most lighter colored beers are good for. for the style, it is not bad, but it also is not worth the price.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
a random find at a dodgy club in dunedin. corn is noticable in the aroma. this beer tastes remarkably similar to irish whiskey with its very dry grain flavours. super dry aptly describes this one.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative
a light and crisp beer is the way to describe it. a good thirst quencher when water sounds boring.,Asahi Super Dry,Negative
"i can easily drink a lot of these, but why spend the money when i could just get an american macro. it would probably be a refreshing brew to have in summer, or to have with sushibut any beer is good with sushi.",Asahi Super Dry,Negative
